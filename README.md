This repository contains a huge collection of tagged trash images tagged by litter type.
The tags are saved in json files using the same numeration as the images.

The trash.exe software is the actual software created by me that i used to tag the litter images.

Source code of that software is placed in the 'source' folder.

Image samples and their tags are places in the 'samples' folder.

These images were meant to be used to create a mechanical device to remove litter from urban/extraurban environment with little or no human effort. Keep in mind however that doing litterpicking manually has the following advantages :

- improves back muscles
- improves neurological function
- improves immune system
- helps gain social reputation

Here follows the instruction for using the trash.exe software :

Left arrow : previous image
Right arrow : next image
Key 'dot' : backward by 10 images
Key 'less' : forward by 10 images
Page Up : Forward by 100 images
Page Down : backward by 100 images
Up arrow : loads data for current image
Down arrow : saves data for current image
Backspace : removes current tag

About the last tag :

Key 'a' : alluminium
Key 'v' : glass
Key 'c' : paper/cardboard
Key 'i' : undifferentiated
Key 'o' : organic
Key 'p' : plastic
Key 't' : metals and cements
Key 'u' : unknown

Mouse : 

- left button click : continue the polygon adding a point
- right button click : close current polygon

When the tagging software is started make a single click on the image to unlock it.
